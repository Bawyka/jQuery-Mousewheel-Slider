jQuery Mousewheel Slider 1.0

Official page and example on http://jquery-mousewheel-slider.bawyka.ru
As for test I choosed a few images from Mercedes catalog.
You can use your own pictures.
This is a Start Up version. 
Support for IE7(8) is not available.

Now that's not a plugin. There's a lot of issues yet.

In the Slider uses plugins such as jQuery UI ( for highlight effect) 
and jQuery-Mousewheel plugin.
